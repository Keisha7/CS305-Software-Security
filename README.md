Artemis Financial is a financial institution that handles sensitive client data at rest and in transit.  They are looking to modernize their system to ensure security.  The main issue was security and protecting the important and sensitive data that is handled.  I was able to detect the lack of encryption for data at rest and in transit.  I was also able to detect the lack of error handling in some of the Java classes.  Coding securely is important because it protects data.  It also prevents financial lost and assists with legal issues.  Software security can add immense value to a companyâ€™s wellbeing.  It adds value to their integrity.  Also, if they were to suffer a service disruption, they would be able to recover more quickly.  The dependency check tool was the most challenging for me.  It was difficult getting it to work.  To increase security, implementing HTTPS was a suggestion that was made.  Also, another suggestion was upgrading the libraries and dependencies, data encryption for data at rest and in transit, etc.  For future suggestions, using OWASP for automatic scanning, penetration testing to find any vulnerabilities and security updates.  You can ensure the code and software application are functional and secure by coding and debugging.  After refactoring, to check to see if you had introduced new vulnerabilities, you can run another vulnerability test.  Some resources and tools that I used was Stack Overflow and GitHub.  I also used OWASP, NIST and SANS institute.  I would show future employers the documentation and mitigation plan.![image](https://github.com/Keisha7/CS305-Software-Security/assets/141890217/18699abd-3515-47cf-b023-b1fd2a8328d3)
